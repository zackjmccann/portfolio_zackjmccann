I began my introduction into software engineering and development in August, 2019, attending a Data Analytics bootcamp through the University of Denver. The course was an six month intensive deep dive into data analytics, data visualizations, and back-end analytic devolopment tools. I walked away from the class with experience and understand of the following tools and their implementation into data sciene:
+ Python - NumPy, MatPlotLib, Pandas, Leaflet, flask, API interactions, JSON
+ JavaScript - Promise handling, d3.js
+ Front end visualzations languages and packages HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JSX
+ SQL, Tableau, R, MongoDB, Postgres, SQLite, SQLAlchemy

I completed the course in March, 2020, have have since self taught and explored the full-stack application build development process. I have self taught myself to a proficient knowledge and unstanding the following languages, packages, and concepts. Many of which are used in this repository and subsequent application:
+ __MERN__ full stack build
    + Connection to a MongoDB tier with CRUD capabilities
    + Express server build with various supplemental packages
    + UI/UX build using React in conjunction with HTML, CSS, and react-bootstrap
    + Node.js runtime environment, completing various http requests
+ User interaction logic with a database to add, edit, and delete information *i.e. a "sign up" page containing logic to determine whether or not an email already existson file before creating a profile*
+ MVC (*Model - View - Controller*) back-end organization
+ Front-end templating using Pug (*Jade*), and front-end templating strategy
